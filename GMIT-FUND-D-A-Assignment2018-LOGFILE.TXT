Fundamentals of Data Analysis   
Assignment 2018   
DATE DUE ON/BEFORE 11 NOV 2018   
   
This is a log file created to track/record activity related to the assignment.   
   
FOR INFO:   
The .LOG at the top will cause NOTEPAD to auto-insert the date and time on a new line when the file is opened. This is handy for keeping track of the date&time.

Revisited the CSV input processing from last semeter's project.   
This will be needed to input the dataset into memory for processing.   
   
23:57 14/10/2018   
Running into some trouble.   
Cannot convert a string to a float due to the quotes still being either side of each CSV value.   
Need to get rid of the quote marks from each CSV value first.   
   
Found a website that might provide the answer   
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39981986/to-process-csv-data-set-in-jupyter-notebook   
   
Didnt help me at all.   
   
00:44 15/10/2018   
Decided to write my own code to handle the Quote-marks in the incoming text myself.   
Can now drop the Quote marks from each incoming line of text.   
Now when the inoming txt is split, the values are stand alone values that will easily convert.   
   
   
01:03 15/10/2018   
Now have the 8 arrays loaded with the floating numbers ready for plotting   
   
01:37 15/10/2018   
According to the picture at    
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_IFzDPHUxHI0/SG0ocfCh01I/AAAAAAAAADI/VAqSLJd0dLc/s400/anscombe_quartet.gif   
All four plots are scatter-plots.   
   

01:50 15/10/2018
Going to start on generating Scatter plots one by one then amalgamate them into the one 'canvas' afterwards.

02:03 15/10/2018
Noticed that the X and Y axes seems to be set to same min and max levels.
This will need the program to check each incoming value and update the min and max value of X and Y accordingly.

Also noticed that at least two of the arrays have an unusual value in them that doesnt look that its part of a uniform sequence but pictures of the graphs on the internet also have this unusual dot in the graphs.

Added in   x1.clear()  etc to the setup to ensure that no previous values exist in each of the eight x and y arrays. This is because i first thought that the unusual value was actually a 'left over' in memory from a previous run.

02:18 15/10/2018
Routines written to scan through each list to check for max and min values each X and Y array


02:21 15/10/2018
Small addition to announce max and min values to user

02:34 15/10/2018
take a break

How to set the Xmax Xmin window for a pyplot...
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17907977/pyplot-automatically-setting-x-axis-range-to-min-max-x-values-passed-to-plott
This should make all four plots look to have the same Axes.

plt.xlim(xx,yy)  not working


03:45 15/10/2018
Time to stop for the night


22:43 16/10/2018
Created the file  GMIT-FUND-D-A-Assignment2018-README.TXT as the README.MD file to describe files conatined in the directory.

20:51 29/10/2018
Revisited project to check up on bits needed to be finished.

20:54 29/10/2018
Found website 
https://learnandlearn.com/python-programming/python-reference/find-calculate-median-python-using-median-function
to explain how to get the median

21:05 29/10/2018
Jupyter is not recognising  plt as the pseudonym for MATPLOTLIB

Local 'import' at time of running the plots fixed this - just dont know why it just doesnt work in the usual place.
Perhaps my I need to do the same with  import statistics  too?

22:03 29/10/2018
Back working again.
Strange.
Rearrange the calculating of the various descrptive stats especially the min & max vales for each array/list.

Not a fan of Jupyter.
Am used to the the IDE of MS VC/VC++ / old Borland VC where besides the main editing area,  
F2 F5 F9 & Ctrl/F9 were all that were needed to get a program saved, compiled and running.

More reasearch into the dataset itself.
Visted  https://heapanalytics.com/blog/data-stories/anscombes-quartet-and-why-summary-statistics-dont-tell-the-whole-story
After reading this article, I felt that I needed to add  VARIANCE into the descriptive stats.
Also,  "A linear regression (line of best fit) for each dataset follows the equation y = 0.5x + 3"

Side by Side plots
Visted https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42818361/how-to-make-two-plots-side-by-side-using-python

22:38 29/10/2018
Now to write what I have found out about the dataset.

23:49 29/10/2018
Adding references from log file into jupyter notebook

00:21 30/10/2018
revisted drawing the regression line.
looked at the video "Two plots on one set of axes "  again
Regression line on all plots now.

00:23 30/10/2018
Revisted the "Side-by-side plots video" again to make sure I was doing it right.

00:31 30/10/2018
Visited https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6541123/improve-subplot-size-spacing-with-many-subplots-in-matplotlib
to find out about spacing between the plots.
Didnt do much for me.

00:47 30/10/2018
And had another go and got a change in display.
Now to figure out the 'right' arrangement
Spacing adjusted.

Back again to do a cleanup prior to final version.

Discovered when removing the  triple hash "###" from the Markdown cells, that sometimes the machine will append one line onto the previous line thereby ruining the intended layout.
Discovered that by placing some "spaces" on the end of the first line that the second line will remain where it is intended to be.
