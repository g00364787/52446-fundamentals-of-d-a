This is a log file created to track/record activity related to the assignment.

FOR INFO:
The .LOG at the top will cause NOTEPAD to auto-insert the date and time on a new line when the file is opened. This is handy for keeping track of the date&time.

Revisited the CSV input processing from last semeter's project.
This will be needed to input the dataset into memory for processing.

Running into some trouble.
Cannot convert a string to a float due to the quotes still being either side of each CSV value.
Need to get rid of the quote marks from each CSV value first.

Found a website that might provide the answer
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39981986/to-process-csv-data-set-in-jupyter-notebook

Didnt help me at all.

Decided to write my own code to handle the Quote-marks in the incoming text myself.
Can now drop the Quote marks from each incoming line of text.
Now when the inoming txt is split, the values are stand alone values that will easily convert.

Now have the 8 arrays loaded with the floating numbers ready for plotting

According to the picture at 
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_IFzDPHUxHI0/SG0ocfCh01I/AAAAAAAAADI/VAqSLJd0dLc/s400/anscombe_quartet.gif
All four plots are scatter-plots.


01:50 15/10/2018
Going to start on generating Scatter plots one by one then amalgamate them into the one 'canvas' afterwards.

02:03 15/10/2018
Noticed that the X and Y axes seems to be set to same min and max levels.
This will need the program to check each incoming value and update the min and max value of X and Y accordingly.

Also noticed that at least two of the arrays have an unusual value in them that doesnt look that its part of a uniform sequence but pictures of the graphs on the internet also have this unusual dot in the graphs.

Added in   x1.clear()  etc to the setup to ensure that no previous values exist in each of the eight x and y arrays. This is because i first thought that the unusual value was actually a 'left over' in memory from a previous run.

02:18 15/10/2018
Routines written to scan through each list to check for max and min values each X and Y array


02:21 15/10/2018
Small addition to announce max and min values to user

How to set the Xmax Xmin window for a pyplot...
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17907977/pyplot-automatically-setting-x-axis-range-to-min-max-x-values-passed-to-plott
This should make all four plots look to have the same Axes.
